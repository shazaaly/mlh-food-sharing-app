          <h3>Observations</h3>
          <p>
            More than 1 billion people in Africa struggle to afford a healthy
            diet. Addressing child hunger in Africa is critical, considering
            approximately 30% of children on the continent suffer from stunted
            growth due to malnutrition. An estimated 20% of the population is
            undernourished in Africa, with 57 million more people facing hunger
            since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. An estimated 868 million
            people experienced moderate to severe food insecurity in Africa in
            2022, with over one-third of those facing severe food insecurity.
            Hunger trends in Africa show that progress over the decades has
            abruptly reversed. After a prolonged improvement period since 2000,
            hunger significantly worsened between 2019 and 2022. In 2023, World
            Vision supported over 25.4 million people, including 14 million
            children, across 28 countries â€” including 18 countries in Africa.
